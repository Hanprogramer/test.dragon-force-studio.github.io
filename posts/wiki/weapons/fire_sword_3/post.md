Description: A very long, thin, and razor-sharp blade made from the unknown.  The sword also has a warped cross-guard, adding weight to the blade for a better weight balance.  And if you look closely a fairly small pommel is decorated with a rare gem. Only the best of many champions will successfully wield this sword in battle.  This weapon is only obtainable via a pattern, crafted in the dracolyte forge.  
Damage: 20 

Materials: Fire Sword 3.
